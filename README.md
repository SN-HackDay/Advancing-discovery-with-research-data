# Welcome to the **Springer Nature Hack Day: Advancing discovery with published research data**!

=======

#### **29 Nov 2017, 9am - 6pm**

## `What can you expect from this Springer Nature Hack Day?`

### Springer Nature's second hack day is bringing together developers and international researchers to build and use tools to advance data sharing, reuse and discovery.
Attendees will have the opportunity to:
- Help develop new applications that use data and metadata produced in scholarly research
- Infer new research insights from published data
- Engage with software developers and international researchers
- Connect with the Springer Nature product, technical and research data teams
- Provide feedback on usability of publisher and repository datasets
- Access Springer Nature content to test and develop their tools
- Explore and enable research data sharing and reuse


## `What is the scope of the event?`

### Participants are encouraged to explore ways to combine and mine existing publication-related datasets and metadata.

Building on the success of the last Springer Nature SciGraph Hack Day, participating teams will be encouraged to focus their efforts on three main areas:
- Data linking
- Data visualisation
- Data curation

### [***We already have some great suggested use cases and ideas, check them out here***](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/Themes_use_cases_and_ideas.md)

## `What data, resources and tools are available?`

### We have a number of internal and external data sources which can be utilised during the hack.

Combined these sources provides access to data for 1000s of journal articles and associated data. Access to internal data sources is limited to the duration of the hack but provides unprecedented access to proprietary data. 
Data sources include:
- [DataCite API](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#datacite-rest-api) 
- [EU PubMed Central OAI](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#eu-pubmed-central-oai)
- [EU PubMed Central Open Access subset](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#eu-pubmed-central-open-access-subset)
- [Figshare API](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#figshare-api)
- [Microsoft Azure Academic Knowledge API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/academic-knowledge/)
- [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#registry-of-research-data-repositories-re3data-api)
- [Several Springer Nature APIs](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#fulltext-xmldata-api) (available on the day and including fulltext access for 1000s of journals)
- [SciGraph Linked Data](https://github.com/SN-HackDay/Advancing-discovery-with-research-data/blob/master/sn_hackday_sources.md#scigraph-linked-data)

## `Why hack for advancing discovery`
The benefits of improving research data (through curation, linking or visualisation) impact on individual researchers, specific research communities and society as a whole. Improving research data's findability, accessibility, reusability and interoperability will improve science as a whole!
